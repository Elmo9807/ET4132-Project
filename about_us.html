        <p class="about-text">
          What started as a hunt for better dice at our own game table quickly became a full-time obsession.
          We were tired of flimsy plastic, chipped corners, and sets that felt more like toys than tools for heroes.
          So we began designing our own: bold edges, clean faces, satisfying weight, and colors that look like
          they were stolen from dragon hoards and arcane vaults.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
          Every set we release is built with one goal:
          <span class="about-highlight">make your roll feel important</span>.
          We test for balance, consistency, and durability, and we only ship dice we would proudly use in our own campaigns.
          Whether you are a first time adventurer or a forever GM, our dice are made to last thousands of sessions.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
          We are a small team of gamers, artists, and makers, and we partner with local suppliers and trusted manufacturers
          to keep quality high and gimmicks low. No mystery sludge, no surprise shortcuts, just honest components,
          clean casting, and finishes that feel as premium as they look.
        </p>
